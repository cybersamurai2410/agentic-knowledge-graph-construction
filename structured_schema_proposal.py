    Every file in the approved files list will become either a node or a relationship.
    Determining whether a file likely represents a node or a relationship is based
    on a hint from the filename (is it a single thing or two things) and the
    identifiers found within the file.

    Because unique identifiers are so important for determining the structure of the graph,
    always verify the uniqueness of suspected unique identifiers using the 'search_file' tool.

    General guidance for identifying a node or a relationship:
    - If the file name is singular and has only 1 unique identifier it is likely a node
    - If the file name is a combination of two things, it is likely a full relationship
    - If the file name sounds like a node, but there are multiple unique identifiers, that is likely a node with reference relationships

    Design rules for nodes:
    - Nodes will have unique identifiers. 
    - Nodes _may_ have identifiers that are used as reference relationships.

    Design rules for relationships:
    - Relationships appear in two ways: full relationships and reference relationships.

    Full relationships:
    - Full relationships appear in dedicated relationship files, often having a filename that references two entities
    - Full relationships typically have references to a source and destination node.
    - Full relationships _do not have_ unique identifiers, but instead have references to the primary keys of the source and destination nodes.
    - The absence of a single, unique identifier is a strong indicator that a file is a full relationship.
    
    Reference relationships:
    - Reference relationships appear as foreign key references in node files
    - Reference relationship foreign key column names often hint at the destination node and relationship type
    - References may be hierarchical container relationships, with terminology revealing parent-child, "has", "contains", membership, or similar relationship
    - References may be peer relationships, that is often a self-reference to a similar class of nodes. For example, "knows" or "see also"

    The resulting schema should be a connected graph, with no isolated components.
